Presentation Template
You and your group will give a 10-minute presentation on your project, with about 7 minutes devoted to the presentation itself, followed by a 3-minute Question & Answer session. Remember to use this Project Presentation Template (Links to an external site.). Make a copy of the template and add anything you think will improve your presentation. You can also use Powerpoint or any other similar presentation software.

Make sure that you address the following:

Elevator pitch: A one-minute description of your application.

Concept: What is your user story? What was your motivation for development?

Process: What were the technologies used? How were tasks and roles broken down and assigned? What challenges did you encounter? What were your successes?

Demo: Show your stuff!

Directions for future development.

Presentation Tips
Rehearse Your Presentation
It can be a challenge to talk about code in a clear manner. Rehearse what you are going to say as a group and be open to hearing feedback from others during practice time. Make sure to practice your transitions among speakers. This is by far the most important note. You must practice to ensure that all of the following also happens:

Use Technical Language
Use the correct technical language when presenting about your project. This relates to the previous point. You need to rehearse what you want to say to ensure you use the correct language. For example, [1,2,3] is an array in a deck, not an object.

Keep the Visuals Simple
Write only key bullets on your slides. This should be a reference for you throughout the presentation, not what you read from word-for-word. The slides should complement what you say, not overpower.

Include Every Group Member
Everyone in the group should participate in the presentation. There will be a time in your career when you need to talk about your code to others. This is a chance to present and receive feedback in a supportive environment.

Be Supportive
Even if there were bumps along the way during group work, the presentation is not the time to let the audience see this. Be polite, respectful, and inclusive of your teammates.

Be Engaged
The audience will reflect your engagement. Just because you are not talking, it does not mean you are not presenting. When your group members are speaking, make sure you are standing as a team and looking at either the presentation, the speaker, or the audience.

Demo Your Work
Practice what it is you plan to say when you are showing your product to the class. You won’t have time to show each aspect of the product; pick what is essential to viewer understanding, and explain those features.

Focus on What Works and Your Next Steps
Don’t focus on the things that don’t work in your project; this causes the audience to lose interest. Instead, you can discuss what you would like to add to a second version. This shows that you are looking to continue to improve, but it doesn’t draw the audience’s attention to a bug you haven’t fixed yet.

Presentation Skills
Just like all of the other skills you’re learning in this course, presenting is a core professional skill, especially in the tech world, and it takes practice to give concise and professional presentations. Use this as an opportunity to teach yourself the best way to present your project as you prepare for your future as a web developer. Here are some resources to help you get started:
